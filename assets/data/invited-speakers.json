		"bio": "Jelena Radjenovic graduated in Biochemical Engineering at the University of Belgrade, Serbia, in 2004. She obtained a PhD from the University of Barcelona, Spain, in 2009. From 2009 to 2014 she was a research fellow at the University of Queensland, Australia. In 2014, Jelena relocated to the Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA) in Girona, Spain, with a Marie-Curie fellowship. At ICRA, Jelena leads a group focused on the development of nanostructured electrodes for electrochemical water treatment and resource recovery. She was awarded several European Research Council (ERC) projects: Starting Grant ELECTRON4WATER (2017-2023), Proof of Concept grant GRAPHEC (2023-2024), and Consolidator Grant ELECTROmonoLITH (2024-2029). Currently, she is also leading a European Innovation Council (EIC) Transition Grant FOREVER WATER (2025-2028), focused on the upscaling and commercialization of graphene-enabled electrochemical systems for the destruction of PFAS in water."
